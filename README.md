# AQ Todo List Application
#### Ariel Evangelista

- Created using Create React App with TypeScript to produce quick MVP and to detect potential bugs early on using strictly "typed" language.
- Backend was created using express to create CRUD function. Although I am mostly writing Java Spring for backend services, express is easy to pickup on.
- PostgreSQL was used to implement and deploy database without using any SQL queries in the codebase, using sequelize-typescript instead.
- Deployment, used onrender.com for quick and easy deployments
